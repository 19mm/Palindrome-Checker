Palindrome Checker - A Simple Web App (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
This project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that determines whether a user-provided input is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "racecar", "level", "1221").

Features:
User-friendly interface for inputting text.
Clear and informative alerts for empty input, insufficient characters, and palindrome recognition.
Case-insensitive palindrome check (converts input to uppercase for consistency).
Implementation:

The project utilizes HTML for the basic structure of the web page, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity:

HTML: Defines the structure of the page, including input fields, buttons, and potentially, visual elements for displaying results.
CSS: Provides visual enhancements like layout, color schemes, and font styles.
JavaScript: The core logic resides in the IsPalindrome function:
Input Retrieval: Gets the user's input using document.querySelector(".InputBox").value.
Case Conversion: Converts the input to uppercase (toUpperCase()) for case-insensitive checking.
Input Processing: Splits the input into characters (split('')), reverses them (reverse()), and joins them back (join('')) to create the reversed version.

Palindrome Check:
Checks for empty input (Input.length == 0).
Checks for insufficient characters (Input.length <= 2).
If the input has at least 3 characters, it compares the original and reversed versions using strict equality (===) for a palindrome match.
Alert Messages: Displays appropriate messages using alert() to inform the user about empty input, insufficient characters, or the palindrome status.
How to Use:

Clone or download the repository.
Open index.html in a web browser.
Enter text in the input field.
Click the "Check" button (or similar trigger) to initiate the palindrome check.
An alert will display the result, indicating whether the input is a palindrome or not.
Enhancements:

Consider adding visual feedback (e.g., changing input field color based on palindrome status).
Implement handling of special characters.
Include a button to clear the input field.
Feel free to customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to fit your preferences and design!
